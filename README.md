# Python.Google.Translate

     ⇨ First of all you can learn python libaries tkinter.
     ⇨ Then after you can start the coding in vscode for google.translate.
     
The most basic use of the [Google Translate](https://pypi.org/project/googletrans/) API is, of course, translating words or sentences from one language into another. To do so, we have to import the Translator class from googletrans module.
     
     from googletrans import Translator

Next, you have to create an object of the Translator class.
     
     translator = Translator()
     
Then after you can follow my code and create the [google Translate](https://pypi.org/project/googletrans/) GUI using python librarie [tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html).
